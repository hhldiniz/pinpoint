## Getting Started

### Building a 'Hello World' application

1. Configure Dart SDK
Follow the official documentation for how configure Dart SDK in your system. You can find it [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

2. Create a dart project:
```bash
dart create <your_project_name>
```

Navigate to project folder and you will see that there is a 'server.dart' file with a 'main' method. That file is your starting point. There is an endpoint configured already as an example for you.
